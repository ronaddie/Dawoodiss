In this research, we study the existing literature to determine the definitions pro-
vided for the term cybersecurity by reliable sources.
[Where is this done? Please indicate. E,g, by "we study" --> "we review, below,"]

Then we propose a new definition
representing what this term is in a different way.

variety of contexts.
