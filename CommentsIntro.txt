In this research, we study the existing literature to determine the definitions pro-
vided for the term cybersecurity by reliable sources.
[Where is this done? Please indicate. E,g, by "we study" --> "we review, below,"]

Then we propose a new definition
representing what this term is in a different way.
[It seems that you have told the reader that first you will review existing
definitions, then propose a new one. However, the new definition appears
almost immediately. What happened to the review of existing defns?]

It is not affected by the determinants
that affected the previous definitions and is related to all issues.
[Good, but you seem to be insisting, rather than inviting the reader to
adopt the new definition.]

but it has advantages of applicability and logical consistency which
we hope the reader will appreciate when it has been tested in a

1.1.2 Cybersecurity Policies
----------------------------

The current policies may support the practice of unethical issues through cyberspace.
[Policies need to be define before this statement can be made. Hence, insert the following
paragraph:]
All devices, servers, agents, and even individual applications, running in a computer-based
device have an explicit or implicit {\em policy} which governs what this particular
agent or process {\em permits} to occur, on its account. In all major operating systems
policies, for all installed applications, are already or soon will be an important
component of system security.								..done
