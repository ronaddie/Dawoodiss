  summary   = {author summary:[This paper explains how access control systems defined in our [Nan Zhang et al] model can be compiled into XACML code]; This paper is an continuation of Guelev04; the language RW which was not given a name in Guelev04 is here named and its syntax is specified in detail. The examples are limited in this paper to the conference technical committee from Guelev04. This paper presents their architecture for access control more clearly. On the other hand, the validation aspect of Guelev04 is missing. The main additional content is a clear specification of the RW language and explanation of how this language is translated into XACML. A key feature of the translation is that some aspects of RW are converted into XACML and other parts are converted into SQL code for evaluating expressions in terms of a database for the propositions that the RW program is referring to. The database contains the actual values of these propositions. The SQL code therefore evaluates expressions over the database according to the current state of the system. When applied to a real system, the database would presumably also be referenced to determine if access should be granted to underlying data, eg to the pdf of a paper or a review. Here is a quote explaining the role of the sql expressions: "Logical expressions in RW are converted into conditions which are enclosed within _Condition Tags_. For each rule the _Condition Tag_ is called to be evaluated if the target evaluation is passed." I don't think anything like this was envisaged in Guelev04, where the plan appeared to be to use the RW language for model checking, ie logical validation. In a sense, the database is used as the "model". Incidentally, this clearly limits access rules to ones which can be evaluated over a single database, and only be direct access to system state. Indirect proofs of validation are not envisaged, even though this might be enormously more efficient. E.g. even if there is a proof that a certain function always evaluates to T, it will have to be re-evaluated every time. },

As in Guelev04, validation is assumed to be achieved by confirming that appropriate coalitions do have access to the underlying resources and inappropriate ones do not, even though they exercise the available mechanisms (for changing permisions, for example) somewhat energetically This paper contains another, different, example - the Employee Incentive Scheme. The aim of validation, in this paper, takes the form: "Given an access control system and a goal, we need to determine whether a group of agents can achieve it." This paper is not very well written. It appears that the main author does not have a good command of english, and the other authors did not contribute sufficiently.},

  summary   = {author summary:[This one defines our basic model and shows some of its properties]. This paper appears to be near to the initial contribution of the series by Zhang et al. It provides two very useful examples: the conference technical committee example, and an example in the context of the health industry involving delegation. Both of these examples make use of access rule sets in propositional form, ie without any quantifiers. The paper is concerned not just with verifying the access control in individual cases, but also with validating an protocol relative to risks such as deadlocks and allowing invalid access - perhaps even inconsistency - I think. Here is an example of the sort of validation that they claim to achieve: "We also show that it is decidable whether the execution of a certain program by one coalition provides another coalition with temporary opportunities that are sufficient for the achievement of a certain goal, given that the second coalition can interleave its actions with the actions of the first one." The architecture appears to take the form that access rules are propositional and global and distinct from validation rules. The process of validation, of the access rules is defined as proving (by model checking, which makes use of an unnamed programming language (is this what later became RW?) ) that the validity rules are true . This distinction between validity rules and access rules is a weakness. In our approach there is only one set of rules, and the protocol ensures that they always hold, so testing, or proving, validity, is not required as a separate process. The examples appear to only extend to providing the access rules. I don't believe the validity of these access rules is checked in this paper, although the definition of the language, and its investigation is directed to that end. },

It has, to a large extent, had a positive effect on the way people communicate. It has also introduced new avenues for business; and it has offered nations an opportunity
to govern online. Nevertheless, although cyberspace offers an endless list of services and opportunities, it is also accompanied by many risks, of which many Internet users are not aware. As such, various countries have developed and implemented cyber-security awareness and education measures
to counter the perceived ignorance of the Internet users. However, there is currently a definite lack in South Africa (SA) in this regard; as there are currently, little government-led and sponsored cyber-security awareness and education initiatives. The primary research objective of this
paper, therefore, is to propose a cyber-security awareness and education framework for SA that would assist in creating a cyber-secure culture in SA among all of the users of the Internet. This framework will be developed on the basis of key factors extrapolated from a comparative analysis
of relevant developed countries.},

Questions addressed include: When should the security architect begin the analysis?; At what points can a security architect add the most value?; What are the activities the architect must execute?; How are these activities delivered?; What is the set of knowledge domains applied to the analysis?; What are the outputs?; What are the tips and tricks that make security architecture risk assessment easier? To help build skill in assessing architectures for security, six sample assessments are provided. Each assessment examines a different type of system architecture and introduces at least one new pattern for security analysis. -- Edited summary from book.},
