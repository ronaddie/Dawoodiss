Figure 6.1.
[This is not a sentence. You are trying to say something, by this phrase. Please use sentences to say it.
Because this is a dissertation, not a paper, you can use several sentences, eg explain what the nodes are,
and what are the little red squares (I presume these are policies).]

as shown in Figure 6.2 [The style of Figures 6.1 and 6.2 is not consistent. It might be better to redraw one, or
the other, or both, to be more consistent.]

The reason the Issue-\ref{} text doesn't work is because in the paper, each issue
was introduced first as a problem, and then as a solution, but

Here follows a classified survey of such issues, including
some accounts of their particular features in a form that is relevant to their
subsequent discussion, in ยง6.5.4.

[It would be good to explain, at this point, that all these examples are "solved"
in Section 6.5.4. This was not included in the atnac paper because of lack of space,
but there is no lack of space now, so failing to make a cross-reference like this
is a mistake and a wasted opportunity. In a sense, the more cross-references
from one part of your dissertation to another, the better, because they create
a sense of unity. Every one is like an endorsement that your whole dissertation makes
good sense.

It is also important to explain that in this section (6.3), the _problems_
are presented, but _not_ the solutions. This is because the social contract
proposal needs to be introduced before the "solutions" can be explained.
This is a helpful way to explain the need for the social contract because
it can be discussed in the context of all the problems having been raised.]
