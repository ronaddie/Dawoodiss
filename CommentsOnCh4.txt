Experiments and Proofs in Cybersecurity
---------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
cyber spase --> cyberspace

This approach
has been used in this dissertation, and the results of both the attacks and the
resulting defences are reported.
[This approach was used rather selectively, in just one case, I suspect: the pwd reset attack . Please
provide a cross-reference to the place where this work is reported, in the dissertation.]

Both a security audit and a stakeholder security analysis are applied in this
dissertation to a specific subsystem of a web service system being developed and
managed by the authors.
[Please add cross-references to the parts of your dissertation that you are referring to.
Make sure to use \label{xx} (to place the marker) and \ref{xx} to refer to another location.]

Original Design of Password Reset Service

[At this point, the dissertation stops reviewing literature and describes
work which you participated in. But you have failed to acknowledge
the others with whom this work was done, and you have not cited
the paper in which it was originally reported. You were one of the authors,
but the work of the other authors needs to be acknowledged. You need
therefore to: (a) explain that you are describing original work by
yourself, with colleagues; (b) list the colleagues with whom it was
done; (c) cite the paper in which this work was previously described.]
