Cybersecurity Design: More Experiments and Further Development
--------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of cybersecurity design is to discover or instantiate: axioms, assump-
tions, and enforced rules which enable us to prove that the objectives are true.
some intermediate propositions that we also wish to prove.

[Even if the reader agrees with this statement, it needs justification, and cross-referencing.
Where does this idea come from? What is the justification? What about 
the views of others, which are so much easier to believe? Are they wrong?
Why are they wrong?

Adding the necessary cross-references and justification is a good thing
for the dissertation, and for you, because adding these explanations
and cross-references will allow the work to become much better, to become
clear to the reader, to become substantial, to become convincing, and to
allow you to express your views.] 

Cybersecurity is essentially the enforcing of the rules(mandatory objectives and
their conditions) required by the stakeholders of the system under considera-
tion.
[This is too simplified, too direct. This approach to cybersecurity is not
"conventional". It is not essential to think or believe the same thing as
others, but it is important to be aware of what other's believe, and to
acknowledge it. 

In particular, to suggest that cybersecurity _as_a_whole_ is about enforcing rules
is not realistic. There are other aspects. It is not cybersecurity that is about
rules, but cybersecurity architecture.]

Cybersecurity architecture is essentially identifying the rules (mandatory objectives and
their conditions) required by the stakeholders of the system under consideration.
The rules ascribed to each stakeholder must be enforcable, and the security that they
provide will not contribute to system security unless they _are_ enforced. If we 
are able to be certain that all rules are enforced, cybersecurity in the sense
defined by these rules will be assured.

The collection of cybersecurity rules forms a graph, in which the vertices
represent cybersecurity rules,

approach is to be accurate.]
