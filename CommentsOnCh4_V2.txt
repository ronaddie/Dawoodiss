Experiments and Proofs in Cybersecurity

The approach of searching
for weaknesses and fixing them is so widely used that it might reasonably be
regarded as a design philosophy.
[add]
It is sometimes referred to as ``ethical hacking''.

We designed in Section 4.3 stakeholders’ policies to incorporate
human values and ethics as much as possible into software values.
[This sentence seems to imply too much is done in Section 4.3.
Although I sort of agree with your idea, that designing policies
properly achieves perfect cybersecurity, it is an idea which appears,
to most readers, to claim too much. It is therefore better to
"qualify" such a claim.]

Section 4.3 below shows how stakeholders' policies can be designed
to incorporate human values and ethics into cybersecurity design.

The original design of the password reset service of the Netml system is described
in Figures 4.1 and 4.2. [Make sure to cite all the other documents where this
system and its analysis is presented. I suggest to include these citations
_emphatically_, eg cite _all_ the documents at the start, and then repeat
individual citations later.]

However, in Subsection 4.2.1
we discover that there are mistakes in the implementation of this design which
make it insecure.
[Here would be a good place to add a cross-reference to the extended treatment
of this example in Chapter 5.]

[This can be done _much_ better by means of minted. I will send a study book
where this is done, and the code. I have sent the sbook, and some examples
of how to do it. It is important to do this.]

4.1.1 The Netml System
----------------------

[The user has no idea why this is being introduced here. Naturally they will
assume that in some way the Netml system is relevant to cybersecurity.
This is not the case (except later, when it is used to display inference
graphs). It is essential to explain that the Netml system is being
considered here as _an example_ of a web service. Therefore, add something
like the following, at the start of this subsection.]
-->
We now consider a web service which is readily available for experiments
concerned with cybersecurity. This system is typical of many web services
in many respects, and hence provides a good test-bed for such experiments.

Any defect in this second system (for example,
if the user has revealed their email password to another user, or has allowed
others’ free access to their phone) will compromise the password reset system
which relies on it, so the second system must be one with significantly greater
importance, for the user, for this type of design to be satisfactory.

[Here would be a good place to add a summary and explanation of what follows.
E.g.:]
In Section \ref{resetexpts}, which follows, an attempt to attack this system
is undertaken which reveals a cybersecurity flaw, which is then addressed
by a redesign of the system. In the following section, by logical
analysis, the redesigned system is {\em proved} to be no longer vulnerable 
to attack. Conclusions are presented in Section \ref{Ch4conc}. 

The work in Section \ref{resetexpts} was previously reported in \cite{x,y}; and that
in Section \ref{resetstakeholderanalysis} in \cite{z,w}.
