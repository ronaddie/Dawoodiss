The approach of searching
for weaknesses and fixing them is so widely used that it might reasonably be
regarded as a design philosophy.
[add]
It is sometimes referred to as ``ethical hacking''.

We designed in Section 4.3 stakeholdersâ€™ policies to incorporate
human values and ethics as much as possible into software values.
[This sentence seems to imply too much is done in Section 4.3.
Although I sort of agree with your idea, that designing policies
properly achieves perfect cybersecurity, it is an idea which appears,
to most readers, to claim too much. It is therefore better to
"qualify" such a claim.]

Section 4.3 below shows how stakeholders' policies can be designed
to incorporate human values and ethics into cybersecurity design.

The original design of the password reset service of the Netml system is described
in Figures 4.1 and 4.2. [Make sure to cite all the other documents where this
system and its analysis is presented. I suggest to include these citations
_emphatically_, eg cite _all_ the documents at the start, and then repeat
individual citations later.]

However, in Subsection 4.2.1
we discover that there are mistakes in the implementation of this design which
make it insecure.
[Here would be a good place to add a cross-reference to the extended treatment
of this example in Chapter 5.]

[This can be done _much_ better by means of minted. I will send a study book
where this is done, and the code.]
