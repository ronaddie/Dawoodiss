A Social Contract for Cyberspace

[Using emphasis, by italics, helps to make the argument more clear.]

Figure 6.1.
[This is not a sentence. Also, the diagram needs to be _explained_.]

According to this dissertation’s point of view, the entities can be classified
into, the services, and their stakeholders as shown in Figure 6.2.
[Neither of these diagrams are satisfactory, and neither is properly explained.

At least explanations of the diagrams should be added.  For example, in Figure 6.2,
the label "Cybersecurity Policy" is attached to the links. Shouldn't it be attached
to the entities?]

Hobbes 1985 ["The Leviathan" by Hobbes was published in ~1620. The date 1985 is misleading.]

Currently, users of the Internet are likely to have agreed to a service level agree-
ment with their Internet provider (IETF 2021).
[Users are usually also expected to agree to SLAs for each service, and for the devices
they use, eg a smartphone. Many apps also have SLAs. They are not just with Internet providers.
You need to mention these agreements, or your text is misleading.]

Functionally, this is similar to a social contract
[I don't think the SLAs should be regarded as like a social contract, but rather, like a _policy_
of the sort which is considered in the social contract.]

Tim, O. (2005) [This looks like an incorrect author's name. Please check.]

Stakeholders
can set their own policies regarding the services they engage with.
[Surely services and servers also have policies. After all, the SLAs we are asked to sign come
from them. ]

a ”contract” --> a ``ontract''. [These are the correct quotes to use, when quoting.]

We must design, develop and implement software that enforces the social
contract, and ensure that everyone installs this software and uses only this
software
[Here, again, you seem to be confusing policies with the social contract. What gets
enforced, most of the time, is the policies. The social contract is a sort of "meta-policy"
that everyone agrees to. In this chapter, a social contract is suggested. The primary
element of it is that all users, and services, should honour their own policies.

It might be helpful, for the reader, to give an outline of the proposed
social contract earlier, ie near the start of the chapter, even if the full details
are not given till later.]

(Tim 2005) [This seems to be incorrect.]

in Subsection§6.5.4 in which all these issues are solved
-->
in Subsection §6.5.4, where all these issues are solved

If a social contract can help us with this issue, it deserves our strong support.

[Here would be a good place to remind the reader that "solutions" of all
these issues are proposed, later in the chapter. Make sure to give a reference.
It might be worthwhile, actually, to provide cross-references between all the
issues, presented as problems, in this section, and the same issues's solutions,
later on.]
