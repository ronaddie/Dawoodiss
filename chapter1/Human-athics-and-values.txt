Fundamentally, human values and ethics should, or must, take precedence in our design of cybersecurity. The reason is that the whole system -- cyberspace -- is a human system. If it doesn't serve the real needs of humans, it must be changed so that it does. 

However, One of the most important challenges facing cybersecurity is the insertion of human values into software values.   
The more deficient this system is in transforming these values and ethics, the more the resulting software solutions are dependent on the human factor (stakeholders). Such solutions cannot always be trusted. For example, it cannot be guaranteed that governments will not exploit the transparency of tracking in search engines to pursue opponents of their political approach, nor can it be guaranteed that people will not exploit the absence of such transparency to commit crimes or trade illegally through Deeb web. 

In this dissertation, we have tried to develop a logical framework for cyber security that consists of two main stages. The first is through which human values and ethics are transformed as much as possible into software values through the design of stakeholder policies. The second is to propose a social contract for cyberspace that can manage these policies and ensure their respect by their owners

By recognizing this and taking it into account, we will make cyberspace much better, especially, to support the rapid technological development and the increasing online services and to curb cybercrime practices, immoral issues and illegal trade.
