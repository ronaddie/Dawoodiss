nor can it be guaranteed that people will not exploit the absence of
such transparency to commit crimes or trade illegally through Deeb web.

["Deeb web" is mis-spelled, and, in addition, has an inappropriate capital
letter ("D"), and, in addition to that, lacks the article "the". By
these mistakes, you suggest to the reader that you feel yourself to be
"naive", ie you have self-doubt that you understand what you are saying.

Naturally, you do have self-doubts. But these are exaggerated when you
make these unnecessary grammatical mistakes. Please always use the correct
rules for capital letters.  They are only used at the start of a sentence,
for "proper names" (ie the name of something), and in acronyms. It has
nothing to do with importance. You should understand that the deep web
is a feature of the Internet. It deserves to be treated as an object,
hence: "the" is required.

[Interesting. Limitation of "Immorality" is not usually considered an
objective of technical research. I think the point you are making will
be more effective if you can find a word for what you are aiming which
is a little "softer". I can't think of the right word, or expression,
at the moment, but I am confident it can be re-expressed a little better
than this.]
