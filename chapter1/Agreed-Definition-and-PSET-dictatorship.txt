I am going to review this article. I think it's a valuable one for both subsections "the cyber security definition" and "the social contract" in Ch1. And also, It may relate for this example.

Agreed Definition:
One of the important things that I have noticed during my review of this article is the need for a solid  definition of cyber security and agreed upon by all parties. This definition must be embedded within the social contract of cyberspace. The absence of such a definition will be a major obstacle in implementing fair policies among all parties. For example, should the issue of bullying be addressed within these policies or not? The issue initially depends on what each party believes and what definition they meet around it.

What I meant with regard to our thesis is that what this paper presents is clear evidence of the need for an agreed definition, and that what we offer is what we believe is the closest definition to cyber security, and we have proven it through the philosophy and logical process that we proposed, developed and applied.

PEST Dictatorship:
By following the current Russo-Ukrainian war, I have noticed the dominance of the PSET (Political, Social, Economical and Technological) dictatorship over cyber security policies due to the lack of a social contract. There are many clear examples regarding various unethical practices that have been applied to online services. I think that ,in future, this is a good idea to develop  the social contract or to propose a new paper as it relies on the PSET matrix in drafting the clauses of the social contract, which can contribute a lot to formulating fair policies that prevent many of these unacceptable practices.
