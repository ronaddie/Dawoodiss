\subsection{Social Contract}
Social contracts are considered a necessity and an essential factor
for the well-being of societies because they regulate their members'
relations within those societies \cite{Leviathan}. As social computing
\cite{parameswaran2007social}, cyberspace may need a social contract
which declares the responsibilities and rights of all members of
cyberspace. Any such social contract will need to enable and manage
the stakeholders' policies, rather than enforce them. Details of these
policies will still need to be the responsibility of stakeholders that
participate and contribute to cyberspace. However, the task of this
social contract is to enable free and effective development, evolution,
and deployment of these policies.

In this dissertation, the need for a social contract for cyberspace is
demonstrated and a draft of such a social contract is proposed.
