Definition of Cybersecurity
---------------------------

Cybersecurity is the {\em logical} process, including design and implementation, of 
ensuring that one's {\em mandatory} objectives are met, where mandatory means the
objectives which one wishes to be {\em certain} of achieving.

This is not a conventional view because it includes privacy, safety, financial risks, ...
anything that is mandatory. This view is adopted to allow the different mandatory goals
to be designed simultaneously, which is logically necessary.
