\chapter{A Social Contract for Cyberspace}
In our world, the ethics of humans can be different from one to another, without the necessity for conflict. There are, probably, some ethical principles that are "universal", i.e. We all share them. Respect for life, for property, for example. But there are other values (ethics) that are not universal. We think the fact that human values vary from person to person does not invalidate the insertion of human and ethical values into software values. But it does affect it. In particular, the fact that values vary is, in a sense, why we need a "social contract".
