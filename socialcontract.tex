\chapter{A Social Contract for Cyberspace}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter links the whole work together.  It addresses a critical weakness in the whole concept on which the dissertation is based. It addresses a crucial issue on which they all depend: "How can stakeholders agree with each other about what is allowed in each other's policies?"

In our world, the ethics of humans can be different from one to another, without the necessity for conflict. There are, probably, some ethical principles that are "universal", i.e. We all share them. Respect for life, for property, for example. But there are other values (ethics) that are not universal. We think the fact that human values vary from person to person does not invalidate the incorporation of human and ethical values into software values. According to this dissertation's point of view, the key to achieving this goal, without forcing all users to adopt ethical principles that they don't agree with, is to seek agreement only on a core set of ethical principles: the social contract.

It might appear that the proposed social contract in this chapter is not a technical concept but rather, merely, an appeal to the good behaviour of citizens of cyberspace. However, the authors in \cite{sheniar2021social} expected that technical means for enforcing policies will become more widespread, leading to an increasingly rigorous, and technical, role for the social contract.
