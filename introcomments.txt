1.1.1 Cybersecurity Definition
[This material is important, but it might be better placed after some other more basic introductory ideas.]

. Because of it is resent

["resent" means "sent again", whereas "recent" means "in not to distant past"]

chapter 2 --> Chapter 2 [Name of chapter. Names have capital letters.]

Then we propose a new definition representing what this term is in a different way.
-->
We then propose a new definition, with considerable advantages in clarity and simplicity, 
which is more appropriate for the research reported in this dissertation.
[But either of these sentences seems to imply that this new definition will be provided
later, in Chapter 2. This is not the case. The definition is provided immediately!

If the existing definitions are reviewed in Chapter 2, it is premature to introduce this
definition here. What is the point of reviewing the definitions later, when you have alredy
defined the term here? This needs to be re-organisd, or re-expressed. 

One approach would be to discuss the alternative definitions briefly here, and explain
that these will be discussed at more length later, in Chapter 2.]
