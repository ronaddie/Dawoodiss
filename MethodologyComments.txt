Comments on Chapter 3, Methodology
----------------------------------

Perhaps the basic vision of cybersecurity is to reach
a virtuous digital world.
[This is a very "personal" statement. It needs to be
re-expressed to be more "universal". From an Australian
point of view "virtue" is not so clearly a "universal goal".]

Perhaps the basic vision of cybersecurity is to ensure a safe digital world.

[This restatement of your view is much less bold, less ambitious. Please consider.
In truth, if your vision of an ideal cyberspace is too different from
your colleagues, it may not be feasible to convince them of its correctness.
If you disagree, ie you think you can convince them, then you will need
to undertake that task -- ie explain why your vision is the right one.]

[In the Western view, the ethics of others can be different from our own,
without necessity for conflict. There are, probably, some ethical principles
which are "universal", ie we all share them. Respect for life, for property,
for example. But there are other values (ethics) which are not universal.
I think the fact that human values vary from person to person does not invalidate
your "project". But it does affect it. In particular, the fact that values
varies is, in a sense, why we need a "social contract".]

In order to reach such a strategic goal, the mission
of cybersecurity must be how to insert human ethics and values into software
values.
[I don't think "insert" is the right action here. It suggests that ethics and values
are like a "rule book" that can be replaced, or modified. But it is not enough
to replace a rule book, in general, because the system must actually "obey"
the rule book. That is part of your project also. And some of your work
actually address this task. So, the action must be more "subtle"]
